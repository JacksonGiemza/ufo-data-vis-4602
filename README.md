# ufo-data-vis-4602
The US UFO Sightings Data Visualization Project was a recent undertaking for a data visualization course. Our team worked on creating three informative and two manipulative visualizations, which we then presented in a comprehensive design documentation. This project showcases our skills in data visualization and serves as a demonstration of our ability to present complex information in a visually engaging and informative manner. 

Through the project, we gained valuable insights into the capabilities of Altair, a powerful data visualization library, and the gained perspective on the manipulative nature of data visualization. Understanding how to manipulate the perception of data is key to creating insight and truthful visualizations
